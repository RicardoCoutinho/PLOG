# PLOG
The following projects were developed for the logic programming class of PLOG in the Faculty of Engineering and University of Porto(FEUP). 

The first project's purpose is to learn the basics of PROLOG while using a declarative paradigm.

The second project's purpose is to learn and make use of PROLOG's logic contraint programming capability.
